        "My website, 'Garbage Time', is about the history of K-pop and how it evolved during the last decade. The word garbage time means, in sports, the final moments or minutes of a game in which one side has an insurmountable lead. I chose this word for the title of my website because K-pop culture is comparably new to Western society, competing with the 'superior' American pop music genre. Also, some people still think listening to K-pop wastes time because it's loud, bang, cringy, and stupid: sarcasm. My website introduces how K-pop culture evolved from 2009 to 2023 and what events happened each year to make K-pop the way it is now. I created a simple-looking one-scroll webpage with typographical elements to illustrate the timeline and history. ",
        "Why do people think listening to K-pop is stupid? When I first came to the States to study abroad in 2014, many friends asked me what music I listened to. I used to say I like K-pop because I'm from Korea and grew up listening to them. Then, people said, 'What's K-POP?' and 'Oh, I know what K-POP is; something like Gangnam Style, right? It's way too loud, and it has no meaning. Kinda dumb.' I was shocked by that response because it is better than people say. K-pop is a music genre. However, it is a multifaceted music genre involving hip-hop, R&B, dance, jazz, rock, and more. Even now, some K-pop songs have a new arrangement or transcription of a classical composition. For example, BlackPink's 'Shut Down' samples the beginning of the third movement of Italian composer Niccol√≤ Paganini's second violin concerto, commonly known as 'La Campanella.' Although K-Pop became popular in the Western world compared to 10 years ago, I think that K-Pop is still underrated. There are so many more great songs. Through this website, I hope the viewers can learn more about the history of K-Pop and not think it's 'garbage time' to listen to this music genre. "
